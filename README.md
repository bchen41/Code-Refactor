# Code Refactor

## Description

Modified existing code such that it is improved without changing its functionality.

- **HTML**

  - Changed title website to Horiseon and added favicon.
  - Changed all div tags to appropriate semantics.
  - Removed unnecessary classes that could be selected just as an element selector instead.
  - Added id in one of the section under content to allow functionality of search engine optimization.
  - Moved digital marketing meeting jpg from CSS file into HTML file for good coding practice.
  - Added alt attributes wherever there are jpgs and pngs.

* **CSS** - Selectors were modified accordingly to the HTML file. Consolidated repetitive codes to be under the same CSS selectors.
